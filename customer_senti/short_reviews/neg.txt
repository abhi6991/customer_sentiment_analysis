Rollover was easy. But since then, have had no contact with advisor. I did have one in Seal Beach, CA. But he moved to Newport Beach, CA somewhere and he never notified me of the move or if he was still my advisor/agent. Not very professional.
What I don't like is not being able to see the true percentage gains or losses on my managed and my own managed accounts MINUS my withdrawls; meaning calculate my YTD petcentage gains or losses on the value of my picks, NOT, on the total sun dollar total in the account. I want to see my combined and your combined managed stock pick YTD percentages, mo., yearly, 3 yr., 5 yr., etc.
Poor service still has not resolved issues no follow up
We recently moved our retirement accounts to consolidate at Fidelity, and we couldn't be happier.
