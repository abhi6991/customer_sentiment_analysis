Great customer service - 24/7. Wide variety of investment tools available - a must in ever changing market conditions.
The rolling over of one of my 401k accounts to an IRA was seamless and paperless!
Typical Fidelity excellent customer service, results, ease of use, and overall value. 
turn over went well. No problems encountered.. Very pleased.
The rollover from my company 401K to a Fidelity IRA when I retired, was easy to set up and easy to withdraw if a withdrawal is needed. The Customer Service Rep that helped me set up the account was very knowledgeable and courteous making it a smooth and simple transition.
I rolled over my 401K after changing jobs and am very happy with both the products available and the service.
Helpful staff both on the phone and in the center, The rollover when smoothly .
process of transferring assets was easy and went smoothly. The site is easily navigated and therefore easy to use
The ease and convenience in using the website I really love. The information available in the research folder is awesome! I love having control over my IRA. Being able to make my own investing decisions are great! I only had to talk to customer service when I initially set up the account. Customer service was thorough and excellent.
We manage our own funds within our IRA and have found the web access very easy to use - wtih clear information and instructions. On the few occasions where we needed to contact a representative, we have found them to be very knowledgable and helpful.
Meets all my deferred savings needs with great choices of investments options.
Customer service department took the time to walk me through all of the functions I needed. They made me feel so important and welcomed me to call anytime. I can manage my account pretty well on my own but know that they are just a phone call away and friendly!  Navigating the website is easy. Thank you
great job at anticipating customer questions. answers were clear and free of financial guru jargon.
Especially liked the greater ability to control what funds I want to invest in.
I had my IRA money in two different places, so I decided to consolidate it and move it to Fidelity. I have dealt with Fidelity off and on over the years and have always enjoyed the experience. I do most of my financial activity online, so Fidelity's web site is very important to me. It is superb! I have no complaints and am 100% satisfied at this incipient point in time.
The Rollover IRA is an excellent tool that allows one to continue to grow capital on a tax deferred basis. Anyone can choose the products (e.g., stock and bond mutual funds, ETFs, individual stocks, bonds, etc.) that match their own risk/reward profile. There is also a strong support team available to answer any questions or give advice when necessary.
Pretty much hassle-free. Commission rate is wonderful.
Telephone service and counter service at local  office is excellent.
EXCELLENT PROGRAM - NEED MORE SEMINARS ON PERFORMANCE/TAXES/WILLS,ETC.
Wanted to transfer 'pre-tax' contributions from former employer 401K plan with minima/no tax consequences. Advisor explained I could 'roll-over' tax-free the earnings portion on pre-tax contributions to a roll-over IRA. All was very easy to understand and quickly accomplished
Since then I have found the website and services very easy to use !
I am secure with the choices that I have made with Fidelity.
Very reliable and i can always depend on accuracy.
I have IRA, brokerage account, credit account, and a Roth all in one convenient location. It is simple and has a great interface.
I've never used fidelity until I found out I had money invested in it, so I find it is amazing I will let it be known
Very satisfied with the rollover IRA process. I felt I was well informed of my options prior to processing my rollover. Also had great contact thru out the process, making it less stressful for me.
Fidelity made it quick and easy to roll over my AT&amp;T pension to an IRA.
Great Service and Website! Great Service and Website!
Access to trade, review the status of, perform research for my IRA is exceptional. The trading pages are easy to use and trade execution is extremely fast.
I am very satisfied with the service i am given and the professional advise .   Thank You
I opened my rollover IRA account with Fidelity for almost 6 months. So far I received excellent advice and support from my personal financial consultant. He has been very helpful and patient in answering my questions during our scheduled meetings. I also got my personal Retirement Analysis and Social Security Analysis and Strategy reports from him in a timely manner. I was with several other financial companies and Fidelitiy has provided me the best customer support.
The people at Fidelity have been extremely helpful and answered all my questions
Solid Company for retirement and 401k solutions. Great Technology and easy to use.
Fidelity Reps provided outstanding customer service and support during the rollover of my old 401K. They answered any questions and even checked my new employer 401K to ensure future transactions were possible.
My financial consultant has help me tremendously in managing my 401K rollover from my previous employers and consolidate all into great funds at Fidelity. Tools for helping in evaluating and planning my retirement have been great!  What can you ask more for this great service!
Fidelity has bent over backwards to help me rollover a pension buyout and an old 401k into an IRA. I have nothing but praise and appreciation for all the help I have received from their courteous staff.
Once walked through the ways to trade stocks and look up investment grade information, the process is very convenient. Access to recent research on companies and industry trends is also useful. The research compliments additional sources of investment and market information.
The Fidelity rollover coordinator insured the process was convenient, quick and accurate. Applying net unrealized appreciation basis to company stock saved tax dollars.
I have been very satisfied with my 401K Rollover, I gained the flexibility to trade securities, which Is what I wanted to achieve.
I met with a Fidelity representative in their DC office and she was able to walk my through the steps that would be involved with my rollover. It was professional and the process was simple. Plenty of investment options for me to choose from.
Have had my rollover with FIdelity for almost 14 years. Started letting FIdelity manage investments of same, however in 2001 took over and self managed. While my trading level is modest I find the process of trading easy and economical. I also use FIdelity for automatic withdrawals and last of all I feel my portfolio is safe.
Ease of conversion from 401k to IRA was impressive. The flexibility of investment choices is great. User friendly transactions through my account are appreciated.
For the most part I am very happy with rolling over our IRA's and 401-ks to Fidelity.  I am extremely pleased with the customer service and the two account representatives we have had.  I have in the past in responding to surveys pointed out that I would love to have a report that would allow me to see what my dividend rate is for dividend stocks we have in our portfolio based on our acquisition costs and the current dividend (whether dividend is the same as when stock originally purchased, or whether the dividend has gone up or down since purchase.) Such a report would take a lot of tracking off my shoulders and would be invaluable to those of us who purchase dividend stocks. For example if a dividend is reduced the return could go from 10% to 7% based upon the original purchase price of the stock. But based upon the underlying strength of the company a 7% return still might be worth sticking with.  In any case this is the third time I have mentioned this with out any followup from Fidelity.  I however will take responsibility for not following up with customer service about this.  Over all this would not cause me to leave Fidelity.
I trust the Fidelity programs and my IRA is my source of future money to live on
I have always been impressed with the customer service I have received when I have called with a question or issue. I have also been in the Braintree and Boston (Financial District) Offices and received excellent service there also.
Customer service is always great and the people are so nice to me each time call and has always had an answer to my question.
I can say that the service is convenient. I can look at my account whenever I please. Customer service is very helpful in trying to answer questions and concerns. Offering information on other services is continual. Receiving e-mails on updates offered is excellent. Keeping in touch with customers increases confidence in the company.
I like the ease of transferring money into the account. I wish there was more guidance on what I should do with my money though. I had to pick and choose my own areas to invest and I would have liked a phone call to give some advise on where to invest.
When my company ceased operations fidelity advisors help me and my wife roll-over our 401Ks into a Fidelity roll-over accounts. It was quick an easy.
Customer service is friendly, knowledgeable and able to answer all my questions this far.
It was very easy to take advantage of the Rollover IRA process and Fidelity has excellent knowledgeable representatives.
It was smooth transition from 401k to IRA rollover, with a Fidelity rep reaching out to me to initiate the discussion and eventual rollover. Excellent customer service, plenty of investment options, excellent funds and ETFs. The web interface is nice, but I wish there were more options on the positions tab. I like the Total gain/loss column and ability to sort via percentage, I just wish I could do the same with a YTD, 1YR and 3YR option. I wish this tab had more column options or the ability to edit, add/remove the columns I want or don't want.
Managed well by the team. I have received excellent service
I received good service and advice at my 401K rollover. Both managers who were knowledgeable on Fidelity's service and fees.
Fidelity just helped me rollover my 401k and it took me 5 minutes! They walked me through everything and gave me all the info I need. They take care of the hardest part. Such a great experience!
Do love the web site though!
I have had nothing but wonderful and professional experience! Would highly recommend to anyone!
I love dealing with Fidelity Investments they are very easy to understand.
Indepth knowledge of investment products is astounding. Very pleased.
Great friendly service, great advice, as much personal control as one would want.
I am new to this (to date my first IRA) however I found the Fidelity representatives always helpful with clear and concise answers to my questions. 
Fidelity makes everything smooth for me. The convenience and customer service are excellent. I would definitely recommend them and have to others in the past.
Very easy to use, even for a novice like me. Which it was faster and more reliable but that probably has more to do with my cell phone.
I have always had courteous service...friendly and helpful...I was given good advice which included a complete explanation of process....good guidance when going into retirement, patient explanations in layman terms....so key for me because my knowledge base is rather limited, so it was so helpful to have procedures explained simply and completely.
consistent responsiveness to questions even if they are of a minor nature
Very satisfied with account from ease of site use to confidence in current funds.
My Fidelity representative did a good job by pointing out that the limited options in my former employer's 401(k) plan, though managed through Fidelity, were OK but not particularly great options. The one thing I wrestled with at that time over rolling into a Traditional IRA was the extra protection against creditors 401(k) offers. My representative pointed out that our family umbrella policy provided more that adequate protection, so I initiated the rollover which went smoothly.
Great help with the process of rollover of my IRA and also with the investment!!
The staff answers the phone and is very efficient at answering questions and transferring funds . They are very knowledgeable.
Easy to get and easy to use! All the information I need.
I have used Fidelity for my IRA since 1982been a. I now am located near a local office (Vero Beach FL) and find that to be a significant plus as I do get face to face professional care in addition to easy access to experts on the phone at any time. Fidelity has been an excellent service provider and as of earlier this year has been an account manager.
Everyone that I've Worked with at Fidelity has been great to work with and very helpful!
I like working with Fidelity. Everything is easy to find and review.
I was contacted by Fidelity when I left my previous employer. They suggested that I roll over my Fidelity 401k to a Fidelity IRA. I can't say for sure that it was the right or wrong thing to do however I can say that there are a lot of available choices and my IRA survived Brexit pretty well. The adviser assigned to me was very helpful although I haven't heard from them for a while.
the folks at Fidelity made the transition easy and understandable. Can't ask for more.
I was a bit apprehensive when I needed to rollover my 401k but the Fidelity representatives have made the process amazingly simple. They gave been patient and helpful.
I also use Fidelity Active Trader Pro which I like very much except the account summary page in my regular Fidelity account is much better. Would it be possible to add or set-up this page in Fidelity Active Trader Pro?
Having had investment accounts and banking functions in separate institutions for my entire career, both have now been consolidated under the Fidelity umbrella. Fidelity's customer service, easy to navigate website, and its educational resources are all top-notch.
The rollover process was easy, the account has been managed well. I had to call a few times to ensure that the account didn't stay in a  cash  status and was actually invested into an account, but everyone was nice when I called.
The representative was helpful, considerate, and explained all the information thoroughly . and gave us information and options .We were asked our needs in handling investment and worked with us to reach our goals.
user friendly, easy process, customer service are good.
I love all of the investment options that the rollover provides. The website is easily navigable and very easy to manage.
Not being a super savvy to financial trends I like the ease of talking to customer service, having changes made and the ease of the whole process. I can log into account and check all transactions - again easy to use.
i am happy with my service. Customer service has been very helpful.
As a novice, I have received appropriate timelines information from the customer relations of the Fidelity.
Everything works really well compared to my experience with competitors. Fidelity has great visual tools and dashboards, and clicking on various tabs produces wonderful stock or bond analyses. Love the secure feeling I get from using VIP Access (the phone authentication process) and it's very easy to use. Whenever I talk to my account manager or someone in Customer Support, I feel I get excellent advice, am not rushed and am confident that I can execute my investments properly.
I love Fidelity its easy to make any changes to my account
My retirement has been very good with the company. Good customer service and ready information available for you. Any thing you need to know they are knowledgeable and willing to listen.
Excellent service answers question would recommend services
Fidelity Investment is a very good investment company for me people are so helpful and service is very prompt.
With Fidelity consultant's help, rollover my 401K to IRA is smoother and easier than I expected. The consultant explained the rollover procedure so well, it made me felt comfortable.
As of this date I have no issues with the company, Its simple to use, quick and clear. If I have any questions the staff is ready to help.
I am very satisfied with my Fidelity Accounts. I look forward to a bright future with Fidelity.
The transfer of her 401K account to the new Rollover IRA and maintaining the portfolio was extremely easy.
When accessing this site it is very reliable . Also if help is needed you many options to go to.
Easy to start with numerous choices of stocks and funds. Customer service was helpful in guiding my decision.
Using Fidelity for my IRA has been a low cost way of taking care of my IRA. The trading fees are reasonable, the research tools good and the customer service excellent. Most notable, being able to call and talk to someone about any aspect of the services is very well appreciated by me.
I enjoy being able to find everything I need in one succinct portfolio. It is easy to keep track of my money and tell how well it is or isn't performing for me.
All my previous calls have been handled professionally, as I would expect from an excellent investment company
Simple, straightforward, good investment options, nice website, great customer service, what more can you ask for? Rolled over from my workplace 401k.
easy to set up. Everyone was extremely helpful. Great experience
I needed a place to put 401K funds that my former company have moved from Fidelity to a poorer-performing company. I met with a local representative who walked me through the process or creating a Rollover IRA account, and then transferring the funds. There are plenty of investment choices, and I selected a fund keyed to my estimated retirement date. Very cost-effective and easy.
I have multiple accounts and when calling in for questions, the agent was so helpful. She never once sighed or complained about all the questions. She was a pleasure to work with and made my day.
5 Star rating!! Excellent stock brokers there with Fidelity!
I AM ABLE TO VIEW MY INFORMATION WITH EASY ACCESS AND NO PROBLEMS. IT IS A SECURE SITE AND VERY RELIABLE. I LIKE THAT THE INFORMATION IS EASY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH HAVING MY IRA WITH FIDELITY.
Easy to contact if I need assistance with anything or have questions. Very friendly. Website easy to use &amp; understand.
Had a great experience rolling my IRA over to Fidelity. Their expert team made the entire process very easy and seamless. I would recommend Fidelity, for ALL products, to anyone and everyone. Thank you, Fidelity!
the best customer service ever. Never had a hassle and good recommendations
Helpfull with ways to accomplish your goals, withoutt pushing choices on you.
When my company was bought out I attempted to roll-over my 401K into a Fidelity IRA, hoping to keep my investments the same with the new account. I did not know the term in kind at the time and was not offered that. My customer service rep had never done this type transaction before and cashed my whole account out. Very disappointed I was not informed of my options during the transaction. I should have hung up and called back for a more experienced advisor when she had to put me on hold for instructions herself.
Fidelity has not disappointed me. Service and the results met my expectations from day one of being contacted by my representative.
had customer service help with the rollover. All went well. Later Fidelity even contacted me once they saw my investment stratagy and invested in a few better options for me. However the functions for balancing and removing funds was had to work with and required lots of math. They said they were working on changes and something may have happened in October, but I have not had a chance to review yet. The GM 401K netbenefits was easier to work with.
Rolled over my funds to the IRA to cover my 401. Have received nothing but good information , and customer service. Wish my current employer used Fidelity.
I love my Fidelity Rollover IRA as it is well presented and easy to use and make transactions. It has all the features that I need to see results, performances and changes that I have made. It works really well for me.
I've used Fidelity for well over 20 years. They can be reached 24/7 for most questions. The website is regularly improved. I find Fidelity representatives extremely easy to work with, and accommodating. However, if you're looking for a portfolio manager to make decisions for you on what to buy/sell, that is not what they do (unless you pay for an actively managed account).Fidelity gives you every resource you could possibly need to research and make your own decisions.
I have moved all my IRA and Roth IRA to a competitor. The trading platform and customer service is not in the same league as competitor platforms. When I wanted to make a trade in my Fidelity account I would go to a competitor's platform to determine the market price for a position before entering the order in Fidelity.
Too soon to have formed an opinion..Last investment firm was awful this one seems a lot better and easier to use,,Very happy so far
The transition for my retirement accounts from my employer to my rollover IRA couldn't have been easier. The assistance and advice for consolidating my accounts was excellent and the brokerage website and options for investing couldn't be better. I am 100% pleased with the services Fidelity offers.
I just went thru the new layout and it is great. It tells me more in a much easier format. Very easy to find things. You and the team have done an outstanding job in making the updates that we have now.
The site is easy to use. I like all of the research options. The roll over I did on the phone was really easy to do. They helped me roll over an even older 401K into my new IRA. Fidelity made the process really easy.
Rollover went smooth and quick ...no problems! Would recommend.
Fidelity made it easy to roll over. Though it is annoying to get flagged for updating the financial advisory all the time.
The rep made it very easy for me to rely on Fidelity to keep distribution in a orderly and timely way.
I had been with Fidelity for 401-K, just rolled it over, easy to do.
I associated Fidelity with my first job in 1990.Ups  down, able to expand the investment as fianancially accomodeted. Now in retirement, looking for Generation-wealth building.
Over the years my tax deferred accounts have been a bullwark for my finances since my early retirement 19 years ago. Thank you very much
I have been happy with fidelity as a secure and reliable investment facility and have been using your company for many years, and at this point will continue to do so.
It gives you every available option there is to manage your account
I have been very pleased with my self-directed rollover IRA at Fidelity. I met with my investor center advisor to discuss my plan for a diversified fund selection, and he was supportive and had good insights when it came to slelecting between different funds in one of my targeted categories. I enjoyed using Fidelity's online analytical tools as I was exploring fund options for my targeted categories. Performance and service are what brings me back to Fidelity; I have invested with them since I entered college in the '70's!
Have no issues with this IRA rollover account. Fidelity provides good  food  for thought and on a timely basis
I am mostly satisfied with the IRA and information provided. However, I would like to see a running rate of return or a quarterly rate of return displayed online for my holdings.
Fidelity personnel were professional and concise concerning the roll-over process.
You have  Piece of Mind  when you trade here , Fidelity has the resources to research your choice, to help you decide how to move forward to meet your goal
I like the rollover ira just fine. It does exactly what I want it to do.
I'm glad I finally rolled my old 401K over to the Fidelity IRA. I have more direct control of the funds, and many more investment choices. The Fidelity research is very helpful. Fees are very reasonable.
Fidelity is our life line. 30% of our money comes from our Fidelity account and the rest social security.
I don't seem to get any service from of for my Rollover IRA.
I am very pleased with the website, which is the only way I've handled the Fidelty account. I can do changes, trades, and planning with very good supportive and secure web design and options.
Less than a month ago I retired (airline career) and contacted Fidelity about three months ago. They were very informative at that time and directed me to contact them when I actually retired. I have now reconnected this week over the phone and to speak with someone in person at a local Fidelity office. The two persons helping me were extremely informative and supportive, giving me choices with clear explanation and reassurance about options and allocations. I chose a rollover IRA and I will have future help from Fidelity regarding a buyout payment from my former employer. Again, I have full confidence that any and all questions have been and will be answered with future choices. Thanks Fidelity.
I recently rolled over my 401k into a IRA and the costumer service representative i dealt with was Michael K. he was very friendly and positive and helped me with everything from start to finish i was completely satisfied with his service and would recommend him to anybody in need of services through fidelity thank you for all of you help Mike.
I was very impressed at the ease of transferring my 401(k) into a Traditional IRA this last year. I would recommend Fidelity to anyone...
Was told I must take RMD since I am 73 yrs old. Not if you are still employeed. Bad info.
Very straight forward to create Traditional IRA including beneficiary designation. Took about 20 minutes.
My relationship account representive is very knowledgeable and knows my objectives. She reviews my allocation with those objctives in mind and keeps me on track. The volatility of the market urges me to be over-racting and she keeps me grounded on the goal.
I am happy with my rollovers, but was not aware that if you roll them over, you can't take early withdrawals at age 55 without penalties. If money is left in 401K, you can.
Overall I am quite satisfied with Fidelity. Your transactions are executed with excellent speed &amp; statements are always accurate. I remember 1970: when we would sit in the brokerage office and watch the ticker tape, and place buy &amp; sell orders by phone. Back then we sometimes took possession of the stock certificates. The times &amp; processes have changed so much since, to the benefit of both institutions &amp; small investors
All of the important pieces are there. My biggest objection is the rounding errors caused by limiting amounts to three places after the decimal instead of four. I don't feel comfortable when the numbers don't add up the way they should.
It serves my purpose, without a lot of pushy marketing of products.
I really like the access to research tools and ideas. The website is very easy to navigate and trade costs are great.
I love all of the info that is on the Fidelity site. However, I would like to see more videos for us not so bright investors that don't really know what we are doing! Even though most of us try to make educated decisions a video for me is much more user friendly. If you would bring back classes into your local branches that would help as well.
When I first rolled my account over, my Fidelity rep was excellent in helping me with all the processes and forms, not only required by Fidelity, but also from my roll-from account, another large institution. He continued to help me through some investment choices, always being there to help, never pushing. I highly recommend Fidelity for their service-oriented culture. As a Customer Service executive myself, I set high standards and don't easily give such high marks! As for value, I have only been a customer for 1+ year. Too soon to evaluate.
The staff at Fidelity made the process of my rollover very easy. They were so helpful and kept me informed along the way.
The Fidelity rollover IRA is a good place to place for me to place the money from an old 401K plan. It offers me lots of investment choices including a good number of both Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds or the ability to invest in individual stocks if I choose. This gives me plenty of options to suit my investment style.
From day one with the professional help I reieved at Fidelity in order to avoid any legal tax problems to the smooth transition to my current stage of MRD. The tools available for balancing my account as I have moved along the age spectrum have all been first class. I have recomended to family and friends that they could not beat the Rollover Services supplied by Fidelity.
Excellent website with multiple investing tools, good selection of mutual funds to choose from, very good customer support when needed
I like the occasional contacts with the people in King of Prussia, seminars, info over the web, personal calls.
Works for me - I would like the option to fund earlier in the year. Because I keep cash waiting to move to the other account and then invest. So the forced distribution at owners election date would be good.
I was impressed with the comprehensive retirement planning tools the website has. The account executive we have is real knowledgeable about the retirement planning process and drove down to a very low level of detail. Your location of offices is close to our home and that is very much appreciated. Very satisfied with overall product and customer service.
Account was moved easily and I am very pleased with the service Fidelity provides. I expect my relationship with Fidelity to continue for a long time.
Very user friendly. buy/sell easy though I don't do often. Buy and sell mutual funds(some non-Fidelity), stocks and ETFs..
Outstanding customer service. Returns are up to individual risk. Overall, great people to deal with.
Keep you costs low and offer all financial options.
I am very satisfied with the IRA at Fidelity. I have plenty of investment options and the support of helpful associates to make sound decisions.
I like the easy access from website and good support from executive account team
I need to involve my team at Fidelity more than I do now to achieve investments which involve energy and other emerging markets
Fidelity representative has provided detailed, timely information and met all timing obligations. His personality and professionalism make it easy to conduct business. The customer service team has been there to answer special questions regarding both the rollover and adding additional monies currently held at other locations. The rollover process was conducted seamlessly.
I have enjoyed my relationship with Fidelity for over 15 years total. I find the customer service to be excellent, knowledgeable people who are empowered to perform their duties or have the ability to immediately connect with the right person to get any transaction completed. I have enjoyed and benefitted from my meetings with our account reps over the years and try to meet in person at least twice per year. Again, very informed people with timely, helpful suggestions.
My Fidelity Rollover Account has many outstanding features that make it easy to manage and trade positions.
Fidelity deposited my rollover check into the wrong account. After it was brought to their attention, they did an excellent job of correcting the error and following up.
I like the fact that I can easily talk to someone personally. Your staff are knowledgeable and professional always.
So far all I have found are individuals offering some type of anemic canned program at a yearly cost of 1 to 2% of my asset value. No value there. Fidelity provides the systems and the tools to allow me to manage my investments at my pace.
Your company is probably the best on the market including all lines of business. Your employees are the best and knowledgeable. No problems on my part which goes back to 1980.
I like the online accessibility with my IRA, it's easy to access and understand. However, I do not have access to performance calculators (ie YTD, MTD, date range). I messaged a rep and they said it's only available to basically high net worth clients, which I'm aware since I work for a wealth manager. I'm able to see it in my 401K which is custodied by Fidelity's Net Benefits, but I would really like to see it in my regular IRA's as well. Can Fidelity make that happen for it's everyday average Joe clients as well?
rolling my IRA into a Fidelity account a number of years ago was easy and allowed me to invest it however I chose
I have been managing my account online and find the research tools easy to use. I have met with an adivisor in our local office and find him to be professional and helpful.
The reason I moved my investments was to gain greater personal control and flexibility. My company's 401K was rather limiting in selection and my self-directed IRA had the mutual funds that I desired.
We expected more than adequate service from Fidelity and they have reached our expectations. Contact has always been quick and questions handled courteously and competently. We will continue our association with Fidelity in the future.
All services provided to me were excellent. I don't have any improvement comment. Thank you and keep up with the good work.
I am exceptionally pleased with Fidelity's services. I recently changed account representatives and felt my former rep was much more responsive and involved in my account
I like that I have the freedom to review, change, buy, sell as I wish, but when I need help, a customer representative is always available. They are always very courteous and talk at a level that even the novilice understands.
Fidelity provides a great service. My account is easy to access and easy to make changes. The statements straightforward and easy to understand. There are many added features.
I find that my rollover IRA managed by Fidelity is secure and I can obtain information at any time related to my accounts. I trust the information regarding stocks that Fidelity gives me. All of my money is still in the tax deferred status.
Fidelity website is easy to use, has real-time updates, easy to make trades at a good price. Moble app works well to keep me aware of changes in the market. Great tools to help me keep up with the changing markets.
I opened a Fidelity Rollover IRA specifically to transfer requirement monies from a previous employer to then be used to purchase a home. Prior to my beginning this three part transaction, I contacted Fidelity to determine the number of days and other requirements to complete the transactions. The close date for my home purchase was set based on this prediction.
Always helpful when I call. Easy to deal with.
i am very happy with fidelity. you have been very helpful with any issue's i have had.
I like the easy to use research and analysis features.
I use several trading platforms. I find that Fidelity provides better and more intuitive asset comparisons that the other platforms. There are a few things that could be improved, of course, but overall a good platform. I have also been impressed with Fidelity portfolio planning tools.
Generally everything went OK, Rolling over a 401K plan with Fidelity to an IRA (also with Fidelity). Rolling over a plan from one institution to another will take at least few days and often requires liquidating the assets of the original plan even between similar plans. At times of high market volatility, there is a risk element for those long term investors. Furthermore, investment vehicles in the original plan are not necessarily offered in the roll over plan (even within the same institution). Rolling over within the same institution should mitigate those risk factors. My experience with this particular roll over was mixed. I still had to liquidate practically all my assets going from the 401K plan to the IRA, even investments in Fidelity own Mutual Funds (and for good reasons). But because the roll over was partically overnight, the risk was kept at a minumum.
It's easy to use. Loads quickly and is easy to navigate!
Ease of transfer is very good. I'd like to have an agent call me to discuss the products that I can invest my IRA. My IRA is currently sitting idle and I need to invest it.
Everyone was very helpful to me that made this transaction so easy. I am proud to part of Fidelity.
Everything has been fine with Fidelity. Especially appreciate the main website and how I can easily find everything about my account status. Thanks, Jennifer
Cust service is as good as it has to be.
I've had a Rollover IRA with Fidelity for over 10 years. Their reps have always been courteous and helpful. Excellent service and I have no complaints.
This has completely satisfied my needs in handling my Rollover IRA.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING ACCESS TO MY MONEY WHEN I WANT IT, YET KNOWING IT IS STILL WORKING AND IS SAFE.BEING ABLE TO GET TO MY MONEY IN A DAY OR TWO IS A GREAT CONVIENCE FOR ME.
I have several IRA's, and my Fidelity IRA is by far the most informative, and easy to read of the whole group. I can not only tell what changes occur on a daily basis, but I can keep track of the longer term progress, all on one easy to read page. Keep up the good work.
I have been with Fidelity for over 30 years. Although I have two other brokerage accounts. My Fidelity account is my favorite.
Online or in person, Fidelity has been good to deal with.
I needed to rollover my old 401k before moving across country. fidelity made the whole process quick and easy. I was able to have all my questions answered and had my paperwork confirming everything was set in no time. I receive emails that are both updates and informative as well. I would highly recommend Fidelity.
managing and reviewing portfolio is quick and trades are performed in a timely fashion. Costs are low. Information is readily available and the support team is more than willing to help when asked.
Fidelity Rocks and is user friendly since setting up an account can be intimidating.
overall I have been very pleased with the ease of use and ability to place orders. Since this is a self directed account, Customer Service has really not been an issue, but knowing that my questions will be answered promptly was most helpful
Customer support personnel made the process easy and painless.
Fidelity has been outstanding - from the personalized service in completing the rollover to the wide selection of investment choices available. Tremendous website with all the information I need to make informative decisions re: my investments.
Received some recent help by the on campus rep at UT Tyler. He was quick, efficient and tablet  ready.  I had rolled over some $$ and not invested it last year to make it a little more  accessible.  UT tyler rep reinvested it for me and I'm making money on it once again. Thanks!
Kyle was my rep. What a great help and person. He has made my experience excellant
I had my money at another investment co. the mix of investments and overall experience was just not beneficial! I choose Fidelity and I feel and see the benefits in less than a year!
Have used the mobile app, online services and phone reps and am very pleased with my experience across the board.
As an early retiree, this is my first  reinforcement  I can access in an unfettered manner in 5 years from now. I look forward to its being there for me then.
Nice to have the guidance of capable professionals
My wife and I have Fidelity managed retirement accounts with which we are very pleased. I just met with our financial advisor, Ryan, who has been enormously helpful by offering carefully considered expert guidance that's always tailored to our needs. 
Our experience with Fidelity has been first-rate.
Very helpful when choosing. Very knowledgeable. Thanks
I made a decision to roll over my 401K. It was quick and simple process. Now I have many other investment choices. In addition, I have turn my account over to the investment professionals.
Rolling over my former IRA account into my existing Fidelity account offered me more confidence and security than the previous portfolio. Gives me piece of mind.
After years of unease getting the support from fidelity to sort out my retirement savings was exactly what i needed! The ease of use, the accessibility, and their willingness to spend time explaining made setting the account up and getting a good overview a breeze.
Great investment and secure feel that Fidelity has done well for me.
Convenient and simple and I've never had a problem with the several rollovers that I've executed. But the process could be better if information about the status of the rollover was made available somewhere quickly. There are several days that pass where everything appears to be in limbo. No info available. But in reality the process is in some status, somewhere, and the customer should be able to see it.
I think the customer service is good and convenient.
The Fidelity Team is great - very helpful and professional.  Thank You
Our CFP was very thorough with the whole process. And explained every thing you ever wanted to know about an IRA
I have received excellent advice and guidance through my local fidelity representative. He has helped me to understand risk and to appropriately divide my IRA between different funds.
Overall satisfied and had good service from representative. Would like to have order history, be able to see orders place over past 2-4 weeks. Also don't like that previous day's mutual fund account value changes show up and are mixed in with current days changes.
Customer representatives and/or staffs or fidelity as whole doing their jobs cautiously,professionally,caring and supporting customers to the best of their abilities.My experience with them was satisfied and much appreciated.Great job...and thank you.
I am very satisfied with my Fidelity managed account and confident in their expertise in handling my future.
Moving my investment funds to Fidelity has turned out to be a great decision because it was convenient and I receive regular reports and updates. Thank you, Fidelity!
Opened IRA because I was comfortable and familiar with Fidelity's website thru my work 401K. Happy with Fidelity business model and have recommended you to friends/relatives. Offices I have visited are convenient and very businesslike.
The Fidelity Premium Services Financial Consultant that I was paired up with explained the pros and cons of each investment vehicle without pressuring me. He answered all of my questions. Once I decided to go with the Rollover IRA, he handled everything and really put me at ease through the whole process. It truly was painless. I have also taken advantage the Retirement Preparedness Measure analysis that Fidelity offers. I have even rolled an existing Roth IRA over to Fidelity. It is nice to have all my investments in one place.
I am very pleased with my experience with Fidelity now if I could find some one that could help with my equities.
Very good customer support when first rolled over account. Contact seems to have fallen off quite a bit lately. Very good access to all accounts and updated daily, nice.
Since we met with our financial advisor, i have been very happy with Fidelity. It is an excellent company.. Customer service is very professional personable and on point..
My contact representatives and their service is excellent. Overall experience is very good.
Had to roll over a 401k at work. Fidelity made it easy. The website is easy to check in on too.
I love the web site with all its features, easy withdrawels/fast deivery easy setup ofr recurrng distributions funds offered
Fidelity offers great flexibility and convenience in managing your IRA. You have a huge spectrum of investment alternatives - funds, stocks, options, bonds, etc., to choose from, and competent assistance is always available. No hype or pressure. The on-line management tools are very easy to use and understand. I have been with Fidelity for years, and I have never had a problem with them at all.
I find this platform the best way to manage my IRA and to get answers to any questions I may have.
I got it done to rollover one 401k account with fidelity to my IRA account on phone for a few minutes.
Enjoy the website. However, I do wish there was cash flow available of all securities on statements and on the system for entire individual equity portfolio including ETFs and closed end funds. Even if it was based on recent dividends paid would be helpful. It is very cumbersome to manually calculate. Thank you
I have had great experiences with all my accounts at Fidelity and will continue to use them for all my retirement accounts. Both on the phone or in person at their office, the people are always very nice &amp; helpful.
Transferring a workplace 401k managed by Fidelity to a Rollover IRA could not have been easier. The staff at the 16th Street location in Denver was fantastic and very helpful.
Try finding forms or close out info. Stop redesigning pages
It has always worked well for me, I currently have 3 Fidelity IRAs. It's easy to transfer funds from 401K to IRA and easy to invest from the IRA.
Truly appreciate Fidelty. They are reliable and dependable.
I was genuinely impressed with the advice and counsel of the Fidelity advisor and was more than happy to let him make any changes for me that would be to my best interest. I now have no concerns about the rollover of my 401k to an IRA.
This was a seamless transfer without any issues. The did all the work and i reaped all the benifets of consolidation of my accounts. Great job folks keep up the good work.
Very easy and straight forward in rolling over IRA account
The process to roll my 401k into a Fidelity Rollover IRA was easy. I'm happy so far.
The account has performed exactly as expected. All trades go through in a timely fashion at a reasonable cost.
Rollover proceeded without difficulty. Services offered in support though was a simple process.
Great IRA account! I enjoy the low trading fees and all the options. The after hour trading comes in handy after a busy day at work. This allows me to manage my funds and not my funds managing me.
The research and information resources contained within the site are very helpful.
Recently went from a large company to a start up with no 401K plan. Was able to set up this IRA easily with a Fidelity rep who was very informative and helpful
I have received great customer service and support.
no problems. discussed all aspects, my rep is very thorough and knowledgeable. very easy to talk with and explains all very clearly and concisely
Our advisor made it very simple and was a pleasure to work with.
I appreciate the convenience and efficiency of trading with Fidelity Investments.
I'm also pleasure with Fidelity's Management Team and the service I have received so far.
Great product. Even better service. They've never disappointed me.
Lots of research information available onsite to help me make a decision
My personal account representative got to know me and my situation and guided me through the retirement process. He listened to my preferences and presented appropriate options.
The information is well laid out and very helpful. Navigation is logical. Research tools are excellent.
Compared to previous management companies, Fidelity is more flexible, provides more options, and insights in future opportunities.
I've always enjoyed working with Fidelity with all of my accounts. They are easy to manage and help is available anytime when needed.
easy to do. lots of help. Thanks! no more to say. I have no more input and don't want to say anymore.
The Fidelity IRA brings convenience and versatility to retirement investing, allowing me to invest in a wide variety of funds
Easy rollover proccess and great customer service is provided by Fidelity. Great investment choices.
Joe was very helpful and went out of his way to help us with our transfers.  He is very knowledgeable and helped us get into the products that worked best for our future goals
the security on this site is great! No worries! I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
Well satisfied with your company. Your staff is very efficient.
I find the opportunities and the prices EXCELLENT !!
It was an efficient process to rollover my account. The customer service reps were patient and answered several of my calls to properly prepare and educate myself before I did so, as well.
Great fund choices and customer service! Easy to pull up and view entire account !
I rolled $ from my work 401K, which had limited choices for investment, into a rollover, where I direct the investments. This is a meaningful capability for me.
My Fidelity IRA has been easy to understand and manage since the rollover. The features at the Fidelity site, the reporting, and the tools all contribute to a clear view and understanding of the account. The webinars help illuminate the features and options available to the investor.
I like the Fidelity website as well as the news items that pertain to my holdings
Have been very happy with people and investment opportunities with Fidelity.
The best thing about Fidelity is their customer service.
I like the personalized service and fast responses to my questions. Thank you.
I just find it difficul to maneuver through the system
The wife and I had 403b accounts with Fidelity for 35 years. At retirement, we rolled to the Fidelity Rollover IRA. We're very happy that we did. We can manage our investments with ease. We've configured automatic deposits of dividends to our checking account. We can fund retirement without making a career of it. Love it!
I appreciate the easy way to contact and knowledge of your customer service
Really value their customers and focus on keeping them haapy
Even though my old 401K was with Fidelity I still found the rollover very easy to accomplish. Everything went very smoothly and in the time frame indicated. It is after the rollover I am having some difficulty. The resources available are not as easy to navigate. There are plenty of options but they don't flow well and I feel I have to dig deep to find what I want. I also have part of the rollover that didn't match any of the IRA funds just sitting in cash. I will have to call to figure out what assistance I can get to invest that portion.
Very satisfied with my decision to choose Fidelity to manage my portfolio
I have had lots of experience with Fidelity representatives over the last 2 years    I have always been treated with dignity, courtesy, respect. I always get a knowledgeable rep who helps and gives good, honest advice. I highly recommend using Fidelity as your retirement savings provider!
My Rollover IRA has done well aince I set it up and retired and is convenient to have money in one place. I just turned 70 so will need to talk to a Fidelity representative in a couple of months as I moved out of state.
the account provides me with all the necassary data to analyze activity
Experience was relatively painless. Didn't take much time, web site wasn't bad. I've seen much worse.
Convenient way to invest if you don't have the time or inclination to do a lot of research.
Quick and convenient rollover process made it easy.
Fidelity is easy to use and has great tips and advice available on the website.
Customer service could not have been better. Very easy and convenient to set up. Having been with Fidelity for many years I have great faith in the value of your service.
Convenient and user friendly. Just what I need. I will always use Fidelity in the future unless I land a job at one of your competitors and are required to transfer account.
Very pleased with the customer service and the quality of service provided.
I am so happy with your customer service. Employees are some of the best
Gives us everything we need to make an informed decision!
I have always enjoyed dealing with anyone working with Fidelity. Their system is good to work with. A lot of information though.
Whenever I have needed any help your representatives have been there for me. they have walked me through every step. could not be more pleased.
I called a representative prior to rolling over my 401K into an IRA with Fidelity and as always got friendly professional service. The rollover itself was simply a matter of filling out the on-line forms and submitting them. After the rollover account was opened I asked about their managed accounts and did get a little bit of sales pressure to use them but opted to go it alone for the time being. Maybe in the future I'll try a more interactively managed account or even the robo-account if and when it becomes available?
so far so good - what more can i say - it all depends on my investments and market
I have been a Fidelity customer since the mid 1980's. Without exception every time I have asked for help I have been assisted by knowledgeable, courteous people. I have done roll over accounts seamlessly and without any trouble.
Overall I had a positive experience. As someone who is relatively new to investing the choices are a bit overwhelming. I downgraded the experience because I didn't reduce the choices by as much as hoped using the filters. Nonetheless it was as good or better than what I'd expect from another provider.
I am very pleased about my transition to Fidelity and what it has to offer.
The Fidelity Rollover IRA was easy to set up and offer great research tools. The app is also streamlined and user friendly.
Things worked out very well for me. If any of my friends are looking to invest you are the one I would recommend.
I am very happy with the Fidelity service. I have great confidence in your professional dignity. I also like the fact that your office is very close to my home.
Very knowledgeable and helpful. Staff was friendly. Didn't make me feel stupid for not understanding everything
I am pleased with the advice and assistance I received for my rollover IRA account. I opened my IRA account 5 months ago and am pleased with my options and service. I decided to open a Fidelity Rollover IRA because of my satisfaction with my Fidelity Brokerage Account.
I rolled an employer 401k over by calling fidelity and then while on the phone we called the previous financial institution and the two reps figured all of the logistics out. All I had to do was provide various identifying information. Very easy and simple.
Complete comprehensiveness for investing in stocks, mutuals and bonds!
Thank you for the valuable advice on my rollover. This past year and a half has been hectic sometimes. With your help this task was much easier. Thank you very much.
Fidelity staff members are courteous and make me feel very comfortable the way they have been helping me with my accounts, whenever I ask a question they are right there with the answers or options I have with the choices I have made since my retirement. I have participated in some of the training session and webinars and they have been terrific.
I worked with a fidelity representative before I retired to work out a plan to convert my retirement portfolio to a rollover IRA. The representative was very knowledgable understanding of how to maximize my income in retirement while conserving my assets for estate planning purposes.
Excellent services from Fidelity overall. I was allowed a set of free trades in the first year which made the deployment of my IRA assets easy. The web view of the account is very easy to read.
I have had problems with this account, It has always been my fault for forgetting to do what I need to do.
Fidelity does a great job managing my IRA account, and I have easy access to my funds.
I find my rollover IRA very easy to use as a hands-off investor who wishes to  invest and forget  for the long term. Also, I like the many types of products I can choose to invest in, as well as the support I receive from my account representative.
Since joining Fidelity, I have been able to quickly learn and navigate your customer online site. It is clear and understandable. If I do need assistance, representatives are quick to respond with their thoughts and suggestions on moving forward.
The customer service is phenomenal everyone is so helpful in answering my often newbie questions. I really appreciate the number of investment options available (e.g. physical gold, bitcoin ETF) and the low management fees. Keep up the good work.
Transferred from my 401K administered by Fidelity due to certain restrictions on my 401K. Transfer was done efficiently and has been very helpful in maintaining my finances.
I worked through a Fidelity local agent. He helped set up the online stuff. The rest came easy. Moved 4 external accounts to my one Fidelity Rollover account. Simplified everything.
The roll over of our IRA into Fidelity was very simple.
I am very pleased with the ease of rollover and the selection of a Minium Required Distribution format. The over the phone staff were very helpful as was the on site review by my assigned councilor.
Fidelity service is excellent from the local branch personnel to the call in number personnel however I do not find the online services as user friendly or as comprehensive as I had expected.
Needed easier access to retirement accounts. Customer service and account reps are knowledgable, curtious and very helpful in transferring assets to Fidelity. I now have access to my accounts that suit me.
I have held accounts with Fidelity for many years so when it came time to roll our 401k plans to IRAs I didn't hesitate and am so glad I did it.
have not had a lot of business transaction with the company, but am very pleased with the service I have received.
Very pleased with Fidelity. Your account reps have listened to me and responded with very favorable service.
very well done, great support, easy transition, good result
Everything was handled nicely and loved the financial incentive to roll with Fidelity.
I switched from another investment company to Fidelity last year. I like the fact that they have a local office that I can go in and talk to an actual person when I have a question or concern. The customer service over the phone has also been very helpful and friendly. this was a good choice for me.
Fedility is a great company. They have every thing at your fingertips to help you. If you need to go into there offices they are very helpful. There customer service is number one.
I have invested in Fidelity mutual funds and other mutual funds for a number of years and believe Fidelity provides an acceptable array of options with acceptable returns.
A very good account with no hassles, it keeps me informed and up todate of what is availiable.
good reliable folks to use and deal with to do business
I have utalized several investment firms for my IRAs in the past, but have begun moving all of my accounts over to Fidelity because I find that Fidelity is the most comprehensive, informative, and trustworthy firm that I have delt with. The Fidelity website is heads above any of the other firms in terms of accessible information, retirement planning calculators, and other features.
The Fidelity team are customer focused with an array of outstanding on line resources to assist with planning your objectives.
Lots of helpful content across the website. Friendly and knowledgable staff when calling with questions.
My husband have been with Fidelity from 2002 and they have been very professional doing business with
Rolling my 401-k plan into this IRA was easy. The customer service provided by Fidelity was great.
Fidelity made it easy to roll over funds from two previous employers and went above and beyond the call to assist me. The site is very easy to use.
Love that you have a convienent link to what MRD is required and that I can go back to previous years. It was great when I did our taxes.
It was very easy to set up my IRA. I was surprised that when I called Fidelity I was able to reach a live person and get assistance so quickly.
Michael was very helpful and knowledgeable. made my decision easy.
I have been with Fidelity for over 20 years, make my own decisions buy but when I ask for assistance it's right there. Just had a total review with fidelity with Tim, took over an hour but a great experience. He did make a few suggestions as we are now trying to protect what we have accumulated which I took each one of them. My opinion anyone having trouble with Fidelity is because of their not understanding or trying to do something not allowed by law.
Excellent service and reliability. I recommend Fidelity very highly.
my rep. is very good and knowledgeable . he has my best interest in mind. my aunt also has an account with matt.
Always able to make transactions in a timely manner. Clear and concise instructions and info. regarding account structure and growth.
Been with Fidelity for over 10 years their research products continue to expand and are easy to use. Customer service is excellent
Great service and customer support. I like the diverse accounts available to me.

I like the fact that I can make my own decisions regarding what I invest in but also have access to a financial advisor who is willing to give me feedback and useful information to build my portfolio.
very satisfied with Fidelity's customer service and the returns on my target retirement account.
I have found that the Fidelity systems provide the tools and services necessary to effectively manage my IRA accounts. The investment alternatives span the full range of products and investment alternatives which I find necessary in managing these accounts.
I am very happy with my IRA account and the way it appears in the website. It would be helpful to see what the market totals are when you are looking at the positions.
The process for my Rollover IRA was flawless Fidelity has very knowledgeable, professional and patient representatives to provide guidance. I couldn't be more pleased, excellent experience.... which is why I plan to move all my other retirement accounts to Fidelity.
Very easy to do and help always available if needed.
The convenience and ease of the site makes everything seamless.

Fidelity continues to provide the service we want and need in both of our IRA's
The process was easy, as well as educational. Every person I talked to did an amazing job of asking me important questions and walking me through how I could do everything possibly to make my money work for me. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable and very polite. Thanks for making this process easy and comfortable.
Process was pretty straightforward and simple once we had contacted Vito our Fidelity representative. He set up the Rollover IRA account and outlined the process and defined the address and who the check was to be made out to. The rollover went off without a hitch without me ever taking physical possession of the check which could potentially have resulted in a withholding and even triggerred a taxable event.
Awesome is the way i can describe fidelity, amazing customer service
Our local Fidelity Rep helped us with the rollover to IRA with analysis of my plan for the rollover, pointing out some changes to make better and recommending additional investments, which I did.
The Fidelity web site is loaded with information and insight. Depending on how much you want to dig down into the data, it is helpful for making changes or staying the course. I am pleased with the outcome overall of my IRA rollover with Fidelity.
IRA Rollover great for short term cash when buying new home waiting for escrow to close on old home.
I am very pleased with the customer service everyone has been very polite and courteous
I am very happy with Fidelity. Their service is excellent. No complaints.
Everyone that I have consulted or had contact with made sure of my Investments and I was well aware of the underlying situations That being said it is great have people you understand your needs and are looking out for your best interest!!
I turned over my 403b to an IRA account so I would have better access. I'm was very pleased with the account rep I worked with. He was very knowledgeable and made the transfer from one account to another very easy.
Good selection of products to choose from, though homing in and finding exactly the right ones can be a lengthy and sometimes frustrating process. Differing restrictions from standard 401K program can be confusing and hindering in terms of making quick and/or frequent changes. Overall, pretty happy with products    services.
Fidelity offers an impressive array of investment choices, excellent customer service, and superior research functionality. They make it very easy to do business together.
Excellent customer service from account rep in setting up a diversified IRA rollover account.
I used my IRA account with limited marginal account extended by Fidelity to me. The Fidelity site is very user-friendly and speedier in execution of trades. Some account information is updated over-night and needs to be real-time. However, all trades are very real-time and perfect and I had used the Site over Mobile device too without any performance degradation. Senior staff of Fidelity are very knowledgeable and available even on week-end clarifications.
The Fidelity Viewpoint webinars are interesting though and do provide some insightful information on the markets.
This app has been very convenient for me. Also, the custoumer service has been very helpful when I've had questions about investing. The best benefit is the value you get by investing through Fidelity.
I have had a very good experience with Fidelity from the very start. Before my IRA it was under Fidelity's care with work as a 401K. I was helped with the transition at the time of retirement by wonderful Fidelity personal, I would very highly recommend Fidelity.
This was an easy transaction and the officer explained everything very thoroughly.
The rollover set up was easy and was referred to knowledgeable staff person to help navigate the Fidelity site.
That combined with a limited choice of investments, makes me less than satisfied with my Fidelity account.
Very satisfied with help provided when needed .Easy to reach represenattive
Being totally illiterate when it comes to market investments, Fidelity has always provided me with confident representatives who make it a personnel commitment to invest my money wisely. Being retired now, this is very reassuring to know my finances are in good hands. Thank you so very much Fidelity.
It was very easy to roll my money over into this program. I'd like to get a bit more advice from Fidelity sometimes, even though when I call, the service is superb! Fidelity is definitely a leader in the service arena.
Fidelity, is doing a great job helping me with my rollover IRA
Fidelity Investments made it super easy to rollover my old 401k to an IRA. Being nervous, I contacted a Fidelity rep to assist me and it was a breeze. We talked about investments and mutual fuunds and where to place my funds. He also went thru the website with me to show me where to find training aides and how to perform research. I've been using Fidelty Investments for 8 months and compared to other online trading platfors, they are hands down THE BEST!
I have received exceptional service and support from all Fidelity representatives in rolling over one of my pensions to an IRA. Follow-up lifetime income reviews and recommendations were also outstanding. I would highly recommend Fidelity to anyone needing financial assistance and advice.
Good experience and is pleased with my interaction so far.
It was very easy to transfer a 401k to an IRA after a change in jobs. Fidelity representatives were very helpful and guided me through the process to have my funds start working for me immediately.
Good service and businesses can be hard to find and trust in these times. However, Fidelity Investments has proven to me that they are a business that provides excellent customer service and that they can be trusted to handle your business as well. Every person that I've talked to at Fidelity Investments has been pleasant, patience, attentiveness, and very helpful. Their goal is to satisfy their customers. If they're not sure about something they will do their best to find out. This has been my experience. I hope that your experience was or will be just as satisfying as mine and that you will share it too for the sake of others looking, wanting, and hoping to find something good that works for them too. God bless!
My Fidelity account manager was excellent in helping get my 401K rolled over into an IRS. He has been with me every step of the way
It's very easy to navigate online, their technology is excellent!
I moved my rollover IRA and my Roth IRA to Fidelity for ease of access and reasonable fee structure. Fidelity is already the administrator for my employer's 401k plan. I got what I wanted PLUS participation in various online informational seminars have been very educational and thought provoking. Happy. Thanks.
Like Fidelity it is solid and doesn't promise too much.If you like to control your own funds but want a lot of options it is a very efficient platform. It would be better if they did not try so hard to avoid the transfer bonus they advertise on the Internet. Overall a good service.
I contacted Fidelity with specific goals in mind when I rolled over my 401k into an IRA. The representative I talked with explained everything to me and made suggestions for me to meet those goals. He was very helpful and the advice and direction he gave me at the time has proven to be what I needed. I am very satisfied with the action taken.
Information is well organized and easy to find and access. Content is extensive, research tool, stock information, tutorials and account information all provide me the information I need.
you come very highly recommended and I am very satisfied with the level of help and confidence that your employees deliver.
With all the different options available for one to roll over their 401k account upon retirement, it can be a challenge to determine what company is the right fit for you. I have found the folks at Fidelity to be most helpful every step of the way. I am very pleased with the ease of making trades and for all the investment tools that Fidelity provides.
The rollover from my 401 K to an IRA went smoothly, and Fidelity personnel on both sides were very helpful.
I like Fidelity. I think they do a nice job of having alot of sources for research. The people at their locations are very helpful as well. One experience I had, I rolled over an old 401k to my IRA and I was asked how I was planning on investing it. At the time, I was clueless of my investment options, so the rep speant over an hour with me showing me all the tools I can use to learn up on everything. It was helpful and I was happy that someone took the time to do that. Its been very beneficial.
The trading platform is great and easy to use and up to date
Easy access, great customer service. Very complete web site.
Although my former employer has been using Fidelity to manage the company 401k for more than 10 years, I have only interacted with Fidelity since Dec/2014 when I converted my 401k to a rollover IRA. The service I have received has thus far has been excellent.
The transfer is very simple and quick. Andrew is very helpful.
All the agents I've talked to have been responsive to my questions as if I were a million dollar client. Although my account is in a target date account I have been treated with respect and consideration. As has been my wife. Two accounts which have made the agents no money, but lots of good advertising. I always recommend Fidelity to my friends, who by the way, are much more adventurous than I am. Keep up the good work.
I rolled my retirement fund over into an IRA after leaving my previous place of employment. I communicated with the Fidelity representative that I was not planning to make additional investments at the present time. Although I was not planning to invest at this time, I was provided with exceptional customer service from my first contact up to the present time. I did not understand the basics of an IRA and the representative patiently explained every aspect to me, more than once. I was guided as to how to use the web site and given the contact infirmation of the representative in case I had additiinal questions. Each time I have used the on-line support the representative has been professional and knowledgable. It has been a pleasure working with Fidelity. I soon wll be investing again, I had not thiught about using Fidelity prior to this experience, I now am willing to gain more information regarding having them manage a portfolio.
Very efective and secure and exellent and helpfull
Great customer support - always willing to take time to talk on the phone and assure my questions are answered. On-line system is easy to use and pretty intuitive.
My rollover was so simple and the process was easy. Once I made the decision to rollover my 401K to an IRA all I did was call and make an appointment with the local Fidelity office and everything was done in that one meeting. I can track my IRA online everyday if I want. This is so easy.
I found it so easy to rollover a large part of my 401K once I started a new job. Fidelity even provided me with a way to continue to make contributions to the new IRA just like I had to my 401K for years.
My experience over the last nearly 10 years has been nothing but outstanding. I have found the Rollover IRA to be a very effective tool for managing our assets in retirement.
Since I've been with Fidelity, I have worked with the best in the industry with regards to my investment portfolio. They asked what my goals were, and most importantly, they listened. I've been on a great path to retirement and I have everyone at Fidelity to thank for that.
I like to make trades like the old computer format , I want to select trade and then select what I want to do. you had it that way ,why did you change?
I have had a great experience with Fidelity. They are professional and helpful.
Unless you are in cash the transition takes longer than advertised. Fidelity needs to automatically transfer purchase prices over from previous accounts otherwise the gain/loss columns on Active Trader Pro are inaccurate. As an active options trader I expect the platform to present accurate data at all times. I had to make a special request for up to date purchase price data. Inconvenient.
This is my first time having an IR, and the staff has been very helpful in explaining to me how it works and making the appropriate decisions.
I opened an IRA account. I called Fidelity to try to start the roll over process. Called for more than 30 minutes, never got answered.
The statements are simple to understand. The Staff is knowledgable. The office is neat and professional. the research tools are good The options and  offering  are well based for a retired person. there is a time to handle your own money and future, and there is also a time to know when to have someone else do it for you. The services and options are there for you to choose when you feel that time has come for you.
The actual process to transfer a 401-K to an IRA was made extremely easy with the guidance of my Fidelity Rep. however, the website is far more difficult to understand and maneuver than what I was accustom to through the 401-K. Even after seeking guidance from my representative it still seems too complex.
Easy to use and has the answers to questions using the menus. Lots of other information regarding all aspects of IRA's and other accounts. Information was for the most part is understandable being that I am not all that familiar with selling and buying of stocks, bonds, CD's, etc...I think that I need to work on this!
My rollover IRA was very easy to understand and was done in my best interest. When I had a question my Financial Consultant was available to make sure that I fully understood what was happening and thoughtfully answered my questions. It was a seamless transaction completed by a company I know I can trust, and who treat their customers as they would treat themselves. Thanks.
Overall good to excellent   product offerings, convenience and ease of use - familiarity with system.
I rate Fidelity Rollover IRA options as being very good with a wide variety of options to chose from.
Process was easy and personnel were very professional. Ready to move my wife's IRA over soon.
I like my Fidelity rollover IRA not only because of its grand total but also because Fidelity's website makes it so easy to slice and dice that grand total. I do my own investing with Fidelity because Fidelity gives me all the tools to use in investment decisions. (The tool I am impressed with the most is the Retirement Income Planner.) I believe (and tell others) that Fidelity has the most user-friendly website in the financial management industry.
I enjoy using the Fidelity website to review my portfolio. The analysis tools, historical information, and different investment options are pretty easy to review. Fidelity also contimues to process enhancements to the site to increase the options available for viewing data.
Have confidence in Fidelity . I am about to recommend to a friend to do a  Tranfer In Kind 
the agent I spoke with was helpful, khowledgable, and very interested with what i wanted to do and understood
I do all of my own investing, find my own investment ideas, but my research partner is Fidelity. All of the tools I need to make an informed decision are at my finger tips on the web site. Getting the most out of a new idea depends on speed and timing and Fidelity gives me both. I also find that a lot of the articles posted to the site help me find safe, reliable and unseen (by the thundering herd) investments.
I've been with Fidelity for a long time and I think that says it all. Everytime I needed clarification and help I have got it right away.
Very satisfied. I have had my account for about 6 years.
I appreciate the opportunity to take advantage of IPO based on my account balance, but it is very obvious Fidelity caters to the higher valued clients first with IPO offerings. IPO opportunities are one of the main reasons I am with Fidelity. Based on recent experiences with IPOs, the value of staying with Fidelity has diminished.
I have been using Fidelity for over 10 years.Good company.
Your online/phone staff is very good. However, I had the misfortune to deal with one of your in house representatives here in the Woodlands Texas. His service was horrible. If I had not been getting good service from you on line/phone staff I would have moved my account.
The account itself, the investment choices are all adequate and get the job done.
I always reach helpful Fidelity personnel that answer all my questions and concerns. It is the best investment company I have ever delt with. I recommend your service to all my friends.
good service great call help when a question is asked like the folks who answer and solve any problems encountered
Find your investment advisors knowledgeable and eager to help.
I like the research options that Fidelity provides but I would like more clarity around the total expenses of the different funds that are available.
I am very happy with Fidelity. I find the online features to be very helpful.
We have found the online tools and phone support have been very good. Easy to use and easy to develop the reports i need. Transactions are also easy to complete
