When I opened this account everyone trying to please but since I have tried reaching out several times for assistance and have yet to hear from anyone. Very Disappointing.  Please 86 the security questions....
Reps do not respond to inquiries. Each year, my tax forms are delayed further. This year it is sometime in March before Fidelity can produce what maybe will be an accurate 1099 form. They usually have to send corrections later so if you have filed, you will have to file an amended return. Poor business for such a large business as Fidelity.
had a telephone conference prescheduled to discuss how to invest monies from a recent rollover I received a e-mail confirmation from my Walnut Creek, Ca branch. No call was received and no attempt from Fidelity to reschedule or make amends have been received.
Since I moved my 401K to an IRA the gentleman that assisted has been promoted. 
Tried to get a face to face appointment. Once I finally did I was made to wait in one waiting room 20minutes before being moved to another waiting room for 15min before I got up and drove back to work. No respect for me or my time, no call to appologise. I asked the on line folks for the mangers name and was denied but told that they would contact him and I would hear from him, this never happened. I called again and this time got a managers name, I called him and never got a return call, waited a few weeks tried again ..nothing. Called the call center and they got him to return my call. He gave me a new rep to visit face to face and this guy made it difficult to get an appointment even for a phone call.
Not a peep from anyone @ Fidelity about what I should do with my money. Even when I asked when in your office in Delaware County Ohio. As tho since I didn't have a six figure fund I was a leper.
Still difficult to shop for and find bonds to buy. Should be an easier way to get it done.
I am a bit disappointed with Fidelity in general. I am not knowledgeable about my finances and have asked for someone to assist me several times with no response. The nearest office is an hour away. I am considering changing companies especially now with my employer cutting my hours has left me in a financial disaster. I am very disappointed with Fidelity.
Functions as expected but have no expierence at other firms.
I have a severe hearing problem, so telephone conferencing is not good for me. Why is there not an office in fort Myers I can stop in at and discuss things on a one on one basis, without having to drive to Naples for such a conference!!!
It was OK to use. Nothing great, but have nothing to really compare it to
I was not impressed. They were very basic and uncaring. I chose instead to roll my money into a Fidelity IRA. Not knowing what to do with it, I let it sit a while, then called Fidelity for advice. I was given options by some of the most patient and mild mannered people.
This is what I don't like. I trade options.  It doesn't tell me when earnings will be easily.
Trying to reach a representative takes 30' of waiting on the phone.
Since rolling over my account from a 401k, I have had no contact with anyone from Fidelity. There appears to be no initiative on their part to evaluate performance and develop a plan.  I would not recommend Fidelity to anyone.
it wasn't clear to me what the funds would be invested in.
Rollover took some coordination from the previous holder the transition was relatively painful
I feel helpless as the fidelity reps do not call me when required.
I don't have more acces to my account and the help is not that is available for me when I have questions.
I found a poor response in getting basic guidance from the two different advisors that I contacted.  Extremely long follow up to calls and long waits for appointments to discuss my accounts.
I hate the support systems very much and have no suggestions for improvement.
I am left choiceless in funds and ETF's at very low costs. I also have the unconvenience of making transactions and analysis using the internet.
MAKE IT EASIER TO RESEARCH DETAILS ABOUT LONG AGO STOCK EXECUTIONS:  UNLESS I DO NOT DO IT CORRECTLY.  I USE TRADE SEARCH FUNCTION AND IT DOESN'T SHOW ME STOCK DETAILS OF WHAT I DID.
Just wanted to roll my money out of this account and you would not believe all the hoops I had to jump through to accomplish this, not to mention the pointless 50 minute phone call that simply wasted my time. Don't call and ask a customer service rep to help you because they clearly cannot, although they were polite. That is the best thing I have to say about the whole experience
Would like to see YTD rate of return updated daily.
Lost to follow-up. Trying too hard to get me switched into an account with fees.
I completed the paperwork for the transfer, which I was assured would go out that day. It did not. The next day I went in and talked to an officer, who assured me that it would go out the next day. Again, it did not. He had not followed through with calling the central wire transfering location to assure that everything would go through as required. This officer didn't even do me the courtesy of contacting me about the additional delay. He had a co-worker do that.
Your site is full of info but is a little cumbersome to navigate. I sometimes go to yahoo fin. just for convenience. You asked, so there it is.
Online guidance is very poor  recommended changes never made without reason for recommendations. Would like to have some guidance as to why changes are being recommended before proceeding with plan.
Took a total of 45 minutes by phone. Poor customer support.
The customer service is poor affecting the other areas as well.
Was like pulling teeth to get it rolled over. but can't find any good help, so I am just letting it sit. As usual, service from Fidelity is very tedious.
When inquiring about my GM 401(k) account, I was advised that I had substantial after-tax contributions in my account. I was advised that I could roll them over to a Roth IRA if I also rolled-over the untaxed related earnings on all after-tax contributions. Therefore, I established a roll-over Roth IRA and a roll-over (tax-deferred) roll-over IRA. I have been cheated.
I am not computer savy, so I sepressed with the web site.The service is poor when I call or chat on line.
I am trying to process a rollover from my former employer's 401(k). When I go through Fidelity's Transfer of Assest, I am met with the following error: System Error
Fidelity needs to upgrade their scheduler. The scheduler needs to be able to know days of the week.Schedular is very poor as of now. 
Your staff needs training. I signed up after seeing matching promo online. I discussed the promo with 3-4 Fidelity staff members and when it was time to get the match funds, I was told the offer had expired. Even though, the offer was still on the Fidelity website. When I questioned it, I was told I was not eligible. My eligibility should have been verified by Fidelity when I funded the account. I specifically asked each person I talked to about the promo. It was unprofessional.
I understand my IRA isn't very large but it is important to my retirement. Since depositing my check I have received zero followup. No one has offered any sort if investment advice. Instead, I get far too many emails promoting online services and webinars. I will be moving my small investment to another firm after the new year.
unreliable , i still like to get my statements in the mail because it is easy for me to keep not a compuuter person but trying to get better at it
I can't enter contingency/conditional trades before the market opens.
I recently transferred back a fair amount of money to Fidelity but received poor customer service so I'm debating whether I want to keep my money here. Had to make too many phone calls and some did not return my calls
I was disappointed I tried to switch between accounts to make changes is another account and made a purchase in the wrong account
The Fidelity website is among the most distractive that I have interacted with in the financial services industry. You don't want to spend time on it and getting information or making investment changes is just a pain.
The help and advice I have received from Fidelity has always been poor. The people are always very unfriendly and explain information to me that I may not understand.
Great Expectations, something that seems to be lacking from most companies anymore, but I am unsatisfied with Fidelity. I had my 401K with them, and they have met my expectations, and I decided to roll the 401K into an IRA with Fidelity.
I have 2 IRAs with Fidelity that are self-directed. I chose the positions to invest in. Although I have an account manager, I only speak with him when I initiate the call. For my part, I can have such an arrangement with any investment house, so Fidelity offers nothing more.
On website doesn't really offer a lot of information and how to invest in other commodities.
It is difficult to find stocks and bonds held by the fund.
Website is hard to navigate, poorly designed. While some good tools available, the trading tools are horrible.
Do you sell the names of your investors. Since moving my accounts, brokerage account have been calling me CONSTANTLY!
I continue to tell Fidelity that I do NOT want to have them manage my funds but constantly get calls.
I've never talked face to face with a Fidelity employee. As I get older, I'm less sure of my self and value face to face more.
I would have preferred to receive some proactive investment advice. I always get referred to the website, which I find to be overwhelming.
I have many complaints and  suggestions  please discontinue the weird practices.
Process is very lengthy. I would be mailed a check which I would then mail to TW. The procedure would take several weeks, evidently.
trade spreads is limited. Dont see why it is limited.It is quite pointless.
My conversion from the GM 401k to a Fidelity was very poor . It was poor in that I was cashed out from the preferred money market account and the institutional class of GM offerings. The Fidelity people have been very irrresponsive.
Why is it that you can not offer a  reallocation scheme when we want to exchange funds in our IRA accounts. Your annuities offer it. Granted, they have a limited choice of funds available but, with computer systems and databases, that should not be an issue at all. As opposed to sell some $ amount and then distribute the amount across other or existing funds you want, offering % reallocation could be much more convenient.
cost seem high, info and guidance is poor, and overall i'm very dissatisfied
As in other years,this years minimum required distribution was handled with maximum inconvenience to me.
NO ONE THERE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. AS SOON AS THINGS ARE SETTLED I AM MOVING ALL MY FUNDS TO ANOTHER COMPANY. LOST PAPERS, NO COMMUNICATION, HOLD TIME ON THE PHONE. I DON'T HAVE ONE GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT FIDELITY...
very hard to navigate and website has poor designs.
Fidelity is unprofessional, and not focused on customer requests.
Trades are expensive and the software is very poor. I will likely be switching to a lower cost brokerage. Also the interface isn't intuitive. Switching windows is a pain and it's not clear where things are. Again I'll probably be switching soon.
Communication lacking. You send me emails but I cannot email acct mgr to set up meetings or phone call. Actually communication score is 2 out of 5..
My overall experience with Fidelity is disappointing. First, the rollover of my 401K in 2011 from my last employer went reasonably well. Fidelity reps are  unintertested in assisting and promised reimbursement if I would use overnight transfer. This reimbursement did not occur even though I inquired about it several times. Then, I suppose due to the amount in my account, Fidelity assigned a Premium Services rep. I then received numerous and frequent phone calls and emails pressuring me to invest in equities and bonds. When my husband and I decided to move this account because Fidelity money market funds are not insured, we met resistance. I understand followup to find out why an investor would leave, however we did not expect delay tactics. After speaking with Fidelity reps, the transfer form we received was incorrect. Then, we executed a signature guarantee transfer request, this too was denied, directly to our receiving financial institution. Only after more phone calls to Fidelity and a Letter of Acceptance from our financial institution was my IRA transfer effected. Then, it appears that a $50 charge was applied. My husband still has his account for Fidelity for the time being, however, we expected better treatment than this. Deloris Jacobs.
Overall, poor  as it lacks a YTD summary, the way other Fidelity accounts have.
I find the UI for Fidelity.com to be somewhat cumbersome and confusing, and the menu selections unintuitive.
Incompetency and frustration. Couldn't get a simple form sent from your office as the IRA custodian to TRS in Austin. They required the form that I walked into your office to be sent in to rollover beneficiary funds as an inherited IRA. Since the form had to be notarized and signed, I was told that it had to be sent to a back office to be done. I physically came into the office in Plano on March 22 to get this done and as of today, still got the runaround about the form had still not been sent. Called 4/17 because TRS had not received the said form &amp; 4/24 and today 5/3. When I called on 4/24, the guy ASSURED me that it would be done that day. Over a month and the form couldn't get from Dallas to Austin? Very disappointed so I closed out everything. Thanks for nothing. Awful service, blatant incompetency...I don't understand what was so difficult.
When I deposited my funds last December, I was referred to a highly recommended analyst. I left a message but never got a call back. I have not had any subsequent contact by anyone from Fidelity. Since Fidelity has done nothing thus far, I have no basis to recommend them.
I find the Fidelity support to be average. I believe it takes longer than I would expect for trades to take place and clear.
I was happy with Fidelity until today, you are allowed access electronically to your accounts at no charge. You have options to link your bank accounts to your account, but if it is not on a list that Fidelity possesses even though you have the routing numbers and account numbers, it is not allowed without having to call customer service and then getting a document sent to you that you now have to travel to get your bank to fill out and mail back in. Sorry but that is useless, inconvenient and sucks in the customer service side of your operation
Fidelity has always been very responsive to my needs. My questions are never answered on a timely basis,
locked in for 9 months prior to election ,what a mistake the way the stock market has gone
lacking performance metrics 1) would like to know my IRR over various time periods 2) would like to see my portfolio value plotted against various market indices. plotted against SP500.
Wanted to roll over a rather large sum from a Pension Plan, which should be simple, but they kept on wanting to refer me to a retail Fidelity representative when all I wanted to do was complete the rollover. I did this on my own, but was disappointed with the pressure applied to try and get me to talk to a sales person. I ended up just doing the rollover via sending the rollover check directly to Fidelity. 
Have another large 401k I need to rollover, but do not want to talk to a sales person who wants to sell me annuties. 
some miss understanding and not understanding  personal do not work with me to make it work.
I have tried numerous times to reach a representative. I am assured each time I call that I will get a callback. To date, nothing !
During peak times of the year like January, it's hard to get someone to speak with, even with the  Chat  feature. 
I tried to rollover two IRAs and the entire process was rife with uninformed customer support and a lack of communication. In fact, one of the IRAs transferred by NOT using the information given to me by Fidelity. The other IRA is still in limbo and hasn't transferred in 5 months. The irony of it all is the one that hasn't transferred is in a Fidelity employer account that I no longer work for and I can't get either the employer or Fidelity to transfer the funds. All I get is finger pointing at who needs to fill out the paperwork.
A couple of months later, I opted to take a normal distribution from my IRAs. At that point I realized that the rollover had significantly reduced the percentage of my IRAs in which I had a basis. This resulted in a larger tax bill than if I had delayed the rollover to a later year.
Doing a rollover is a very complicated experience. I was not assisted well with the whole process except where I was supposed to get the rebate for doing this rollover. Someone dropped the ball in making sure I got that. So I had to track it myself and backtrack to get this taken care of.
Needed money quickly and this could not have been any easier
I am investment illiterate and while I understand no customer service agent can recommend a particular action but I need all the guidance I can get. I am not at all happy with the result so far.
There was a long wait time and the investment specialist I spoke with left me on hold after we've discussed that I'm investing in a Fidelity product. Another specialist picked up the phone without knowing what was discussed previously with the other person, so he has to read the notes. That was unprofessional and time wasted!!!!
The location for me is far. Any question I have is answered lately. I need to spend more time using your resources. So far this is my problem. 
We set up the dividends to be deposited into the check book and this has not been done for 2 months in a row.
Only 6 months of my investments being in this 401 account, I have been able to review the account with ease. Not enough me to evaluate it's value.
As a newcomer to managing my own investment, I really need training, consultation and mentoring. The resources and tools available are good but it is overwhelming and information over load.
No assistance whatsoever and about ready to close all my accounts
The information online isn't much help. I must go into a local Fidelity store to get answers. I can't just stop in there without an appointment.
I have never had such bad service. I cannot believe how I have been treated as a customer. I pass the word to others. I got no assistance. My IRA is still sitting in cash. I am looking to leave Fedelity.
It doesn't show me the expected move each week for the underlying.
Attempted to have several of my 403 b's rolled over into one IRA. After hand delivering the paperwork for this to be accomplished all of my paperwork was lost. They were never able to find it nor did they follow up with me regarding this mishap.I will be removing all of my money from Fidelity and will take it else where.
I don't understand why the IRA tool doesn't provide real time security quotes. This is something I can get on Yahoo Finance for free, why can't I get it from Fidelity where I am holding my retirement savings?
Very disappointed with the new viewing format and not very easy to maneuver in and out of accounts
I am going though a bad time with my husband. I had to retire and was to young to collect S.S. I had to take money out of my 401/IRA and have been taxed a lot. now my retirement money is less than haft of what I started with.the taxes you charge are too much.
NEW CUSTOMER SO FAR AVERAGE EVERY TIME I CALL THE PERSON GIVES ME THEIR EX IF I HAVE QUESTIONS LEAVE MESSAGE THEY NEVER GET BACK TO ME
Fidelity pushed you right into opening an account and I can't find a single link on the page that tells you, legally, the terms of the account. Nothing. Just START. GET STARTED. With What?  ?      
My only complaint that each time I roll over an IRA the IRS seems to think it is a distribution. It causes a hassle to communicate with them to clear it up.
Account is nothing special. While easy to access, difficult to talk with someone or get help with the research section to understand the data for a given mutual fund or stock.
Attempts to coordinate a portfolio review with a Fidelity representative have yielded discouraging results despite leaving messages for a call back and a request for follow up. As a Fidelity Premium Services client, this has been dissapointing. If I was not so busy with work, I would take the time to find an alternate IRA account holder. I even called to confirm an appointment, and before I left my office to come to the appointment, I had called to confirm, and there was no record of having this appointment and could not contact the local office directly, except via a central number who could not give me the information I needed to speak directly to the person I had an appointment with. The lines at the local office were not available, and I did not receive a return call back
It would be good to offer reminders once in awhile about the easiest ways to make a move (either trade, buy or sell) on a held stock or fund where indviduals view their personal holdings on your website.
I feel like I have no relationship with Fidelity like I have with my bank. Although I have money in an account and have made several calls no one seems to get back with me even after hearing the person I first met when I completed my rollover was no longer with the company. The TV ads are great but I don't feel what I see on TV is what is being delivered.
I've given this feedback before, but my suggestion still has not been implemented. Before recent changes, Fidelity had information at the bottom of portfolio activity that was labeled  not included in totals  or something to that effect. It was basically, the amount of activity such as mutual funds that reflected the prior days activity. Currently, if you look at a day's activity, you must add mutual funds changes and subtract the change from the total to see the day's  actual  activity change. After the mutual funds update later that evening, the true change for the day is reflected.
